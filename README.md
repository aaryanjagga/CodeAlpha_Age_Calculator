📅 Age Calculator | CodeAlpha Internship Task 1

A modern, responsive web application to calculate precise age from a date of birth.
This project was developed as part of my Web Development Internship at CodeAlpha. It goes beyond the basic requirements by implementing advanced UX features like auto-focus fields, keyboard navigation, and smooth animations.

🚀 Features
Precise Calculation: accurate age calculation in years, months, and days (handling leap years and month lengths).

UX Enhancements:

Auto-Focus: Cursor automatically jumps to the next input field (DD → MM → YYYY) as you type.

Smart Navigation: Backspace on an empty field automatically moves focus to the previous input.

Enter Key Support: Pressing 'Enter' triggers the calculation instantly.

Visuals:

Tailwind CSS: Fully responsive, modern UI with a clean gradient background.

Animations: Smooth number counting and staggered card entry animations.

Fun Extra: Calculates and displays the specific Day of the Week you were born (e.g., "You were born on a Tuesday!").

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5: Semantic structure.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS via CDN): Styling and responsiveness.

JavaScript (ES6+): Logic, DOM manipulation, and event listeners.
